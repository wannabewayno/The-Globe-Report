## Your weather, your way
Love boring weather-dashboards?
Great, stop reading and definitely don't click that link above.

This is a simple app built upon the Open Weather API that retreives real time weather information and a a 5-day forecast. 

### tell me more?
Right, it's pretty intuitve; but in the interest if being clear, here's how you use it.
* Navigate to <a href="https://wannabewayno.github.io/The-Globe-Report/">The Globe Report</a>, 
* stare at the cherry blossoms a bit, then remember you came to find out the weather
* find the search bar and type in the city you want to find
    * Note, that american cities are prioritised, so if you want to know what the weather is like in Rome, *Italy*, you can type a country code after a city like this Rome,IT. Otherwise, you'll only see Rome,US. Got it? Be specific where you can, but otherwise it'll tell you!
* Hit enter and get your weather fix!
* scroll down to see the 5 day weather forecast.
* All units are in metric unless otherwise stated.

### anything else?
Anytime you search for a city, it will show up in the side bar so you can check it later.
They're saved to your browser so no need to type it again.

if the search bar is getting cluttered, you can remove them at anytime by clicking on the cross next to it. If you're feeling impulsive, hit the clear all button and see what happens.

I think that's it. 
Enjoy!
